# **Understanding CI/CD and GitHub Actions**

## **1. Introduction to CI/CD**

### **1.1 What is CI/CD?**

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day.
  - Each integration is verified by an automated build and automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

- **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
  - An extension of CI that ensures code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
  - Focuses on delivering all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

- **Continuous Deployment:**
  - Goes a step further than continuous delivery by automatically deploying code to production after passing the necessary tests.
  - Removes the need for manual approvals, relying entirely on automated testing to ensure code quality.

### **1.2 Importance in DevOps**

- **DevOps Culture:**
  - Emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams.
  - CI/CD is a key practice in DevOps to deliver software quickly and reliably.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Faster Delivery:** Accelerates the release of new features and fixes.
  - **Improved Quality:** Automated testing reduces bugs and errors.
  - **Enhanced Collaboration:** Encourages shared responsibility among teams.
  - **Reduced Risk:** Smaller, incremental updates minimize the impact of changes.

## **2. Components of CI/CD**

### **2.1 Continuous Integration**

- **Code Integration:**
  - Developers merge code changes frequently into a central repository.
  - Early detection of conflicts and integration issues.

- **Automated Builds:**
  - Code is automatically compiled and built after each commit.
  - Ensures that the codebase remains in a buildable state.

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests run with each build.
  - Immediate feedback on the impact of changes.

### **2.2 Continuous Delivery**

- **Artifact Creation:**
  - Build artifacts are created and stored for deployment.
- **Environment Deployment:**
  - Code is deployed to staging, testing, or QA environments.
- **Manual Approval (Optional):**
  - Human intervention may be required before deploying to production.

### **2.3 Continuous Deployment**

- **Automated Deployment:**
  - Code changes that pass automated tests are automatically deployed to production.
- **Monitoring and Feedback:**
  - Continuous monitoring of the production environment.
  - Quick rollback mechanisms in case of issues.

- **Create a directory for workflows:**

  ```bash
  mkdir -p .github/workflows
  ```

- **Create a workflow file:**

  ```bash
  touch .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
  ```

#### **Step 3: Write the Workflow Configuration**

- **Example Workflow for a Node.js Application:**

  ```yaml
  name: CI/CD Pipeline

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Set up Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3

            path: build/

    deploy:
      needs: build
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

      steps:
        - name: Download artifacts
          uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: build-artifacts

        - name: Deploy to server
          env:
            SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
            SERVER_USER: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
            SERVER_HOST: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          run: |
            mkdir -p ~/.ssh
            echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
            chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
            scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -r build/ $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST:/var/www/myapp
  ```

#### **Step 4: Explanation of the Workflow**

- **Workflow Name:**

  ```yaml

  ```

- **Triggers (`on`):**

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main
    pull_request:
      branches:
        - main
  ```

  - **Triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.**

- **Jobs:**

  **a. Build Job:**

  - **Environment:**

    ```yaml
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ```

  - **Steps:**

    - **Checkout Code:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      ```

    - **Set Up Node.js:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      ```

    - **Install Dependencies:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      ```

    - **Run Tests:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      ```

    - **Build Application:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
      ```

    - **Archive Artifacts:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Archive production artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: build/
      ```

  **b. Deploy Job:**

  - **Dependencies:**

    ```yaml
    needs: build
    ```

    - **Runs after the `build` job completes successfully.**

  - **Conditional Execution:**

    ```yaml
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    ```

    - **Deploys only when the `main` branch is updated.**

  - **Steps:**

    - **Download Artifacts:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Download artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
      ```

    - **Deploy to Server:**

      ```yaml
      - name: Deploy to server
        env:
          SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          SERVER_USER: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
          SERVER_HOST: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -r build/ $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST:/var/www/myapp
      ```

      - **Uses SSH to securely copy build artifacts to the deployment server.**
      - **Sensitive information is stored in GitHub Secrets.**

#### **Step 5: Configure GitHub Secrets**

- **Navigate to your GitHub repository.**
- **Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.**
- **Add the following secrets:**
  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private SSH key for connecting to your server.
  - `SERVER_USER`: The username on the deployment server.
  - `SERVER_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the deployment server.

#### **Step 6: Commit and Push Changes**

- **Add the workflow file to Git:**

  ```bash
  git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
  git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline workflow"
  git push origin main
  ```

- **GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow upon push.**

#### **Step 7: Monitor the Workflow**

- **Navigate to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository.**
- **Select the running workflow to view logs and progress.**
